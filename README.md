## Idea:

Create a website that can import a dataset from the Apple Health App that can display visualizations for descriptive statistics based on that dataset. 

## Getting Started

Start by creating a python virtual environment, activating it, and installing dependencies in the ```requirements.txt``` file

### Windows

First, if you have not already created the FinalProject.db, run the ```db_populate.py``` script

Now (or if you already have the FinalProject.db) run the ```app.py``` script

### Linux

In a linux environment, use ```./start_up.sh``` to start the website locally.

This will run the initializing of the database if it is not created, then it will run the app
